Many students struggle to choose the right career path due to a lack of knowledge about available options, a lack of access to reliable information, and a lack of understanding about how to achieve their career goals.
These challenges can create significant barriers to career advancement and cause individuals to feel unsure or overwhelmed about their career path, leading to hasty and uninformed decisions.
To address these issues, there is a need for a career guidance website that can provide accurate, comprehensive, and personalized information about different careers, scholarships, and financial assistance options available to students.
Such a website can help students understand their interests, skills, and personality traits to make informed decisions about their career paths.
The website should also assist students in choosing the right courses or degrees after 10th or 12th grade, respectively.
By empowering students to make informed decisions about their careers, the website can lead to better outcomes and a more fulfilling life for students.
